# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

An exploratory data analysis project examining the impact of GDP on life expectancy, considering the country of origin for each data point.

## Introduction

This project explores the relationship between a country's GDP and life expectancy. It leverages data science techniques to analyze and visualize patterns in the data.

## Features

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of variables and exploring relationships.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
- Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to understand correlations and trends.
- Regression Modeling: Building regression models to quantify the impact of GDP on life expectancy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdp-life-expectancy-analysis.git`
2. Install dependencies:  `conda create --name myenv --file requirements.txt`
